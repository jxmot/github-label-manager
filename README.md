# github-label-manager

**NOTE: This project is currently a "work-in-progress". And will be in various states between "working" and "not working". The master branch will not necessarily be the most current.**

**2020-08-27 : Revisited project, fixed some minor bugs. Had to update the git token(not visible in repo).**

**2018-04-20 : Added a verticle scroll and max height to the label table. And I've working on some custom fonts(icons) for indicating the origin of the label (GitHub vs imported) and for indicating the origin-related states.**

**2018-04-17 : Added emoji rendering to labels, but the code needs some refactoring due to duplication. Also need to investigate some of the error handling so that the messages and/or actions are appropraite ("Read Labels" w/o a selected repo)**

**2018-04-10 : Label file export/import and row marking (as imported) is working, needs additional testing and
integration of imported labels into other operations.**

**2018-03-31 : Basic label retrieval from a repo, label edit, undo, and mark for deletion are working.**

**Major To Do's : label deletion from repo, label upload to repo, new label creation**

A web based utility to manage GitHub labels.

# History

GitHub is a great tool, and I appreciate all the work that has gone into it. But lately I've been using *issues* on my repositories to note bugs, enhancements, etc. And I like the fact that I can use *labels*. However, it would have been *really nice* to make the labels global in respect to the repositories. For example there is a group of 4 or 5 labels that I would like to use *everywhere*. And getting them to each of the desired repositories is no effortless task! So, this is what I came up with....

# Overview

This utility will provide - 

* A means to :
    * Edit labels in a fashion similar to how it's done on GitHub
    * Save a repository's labels to a JSON file
    * Load labels from JSON files and upload the labels to a repository
    * Import additional labels to a label list
    * *TBD*
    
This application is not intended to be deployed for *multi-user* scenarios. It is intended to assist an *individual* in the task of managing GitHub issue labels across a number of repositories. Each user(*repository owner/collaborator*) will require their own separate installation of this application. This application can be hosted either locally or on an Internet accessible web server. However the latter is *not recommended* unless sufficient security has been implemented.

Label data files can be shared between users. Those files do not contain and GitHub user or repository information. However in situations where label data files are automatically saved the file names will contain a repository name.

All data files are kept on the server where the application is ran from. They will be found in the `./data` folder.

## Running the Application

**Do not host this application on a web server. Since it can make changes to a repository labels without "logging in" it should be ran in a protected environment.**

A local web server like XAMPP or MAMP is required. Run this application in a browser and direct it to where the application is hosted.

Another requirement is that you obtain a GitHub *personal access token*. This can be done by visiting your profile and accessing *Developer Settings*. From there choose *Personal Access Tokens* and generate a new token. 

Follow these steps:

1) Obtain and install a local web server application. You must have PHP installed!
2) Rename `www/data/config/example_gitlabels.json` TO `www/data/config/`**`_gitlabels.json`**
3) Edit **`_gitlabels.json`** :

```
{
    "owner": "repo_owner",
    "token": "token ????????????????????????????????????"
}
```

Replace:
  `"repo_owner"` with your GitHub user *name*.
  `????????????????????????????????????` with **your** *personal access token*
  
4) Save the file.
5) Copy the **contents** including all sub-folders of the `www` folder in to the location where your web server expects to find its files. It is possible to contain the application within its own sub-folder.
6) Run the application in your browser - `http://localhost/` or `http://localhost/test` if for example, you placed the application in a sub-folder named `test`.

    
## Initial GUI Design

*A wireframe is your friend....* and time is well spent making one. And *Mock ups* are a good alternative.

This was my initial pass at putting together a GUI for this application - 

<p align="center">
  <img src="./mdimg/wireframe-1-697x551.jpg" alt="Sort-of Wireframe" txt="Sort-of Wireframe" width="50%">
</p>

Then after some thought and making adjustments I ended up with this -

<p align="center">
  <img src="./mdimg/wireframe-2-660x489.jpg" alt="Sort-of Wireframe" txt="Sort-of Wireframe" width="50%">
</p>


Changes included - 

* Made the repository selection box *resizable*
* Moved a button, added more at the bottom of the page
* Worked out how I want the repository information to be presented.
* Reworked the label area, decided to use icons for action selection and label state indication

## Defining the Operation

Now that I had my mock-up I could begin finalizing how the application was going to operate. It was also an opportunity at this point to make additional adjustments to the GUI.

But before I started on *operations* I had to come up with some *rules*. These rules help define some of the operations and their associated indicators. Here are some examples - 

* Repository lists will be saved automatically and reused during run-time rather than reacquire the list from GitHub.
* When a repository's label list is read it is saved(*backed up*) automatically *with a time stamped file name*.
* Labels can have the following operations done to them - 
    * Edit - change the label's characteristics
    * Delete - marks the label for deletion, changes to the repository or exporting require confirmation. If the label is new(ID is null) then it is removed from the list immediately
    * Undo - to last state or undelete to last state 
* Labels can be in one of four states - 
    * Unchanged - 
        * label is new and empty
        * has just been retrieved
        * has just been saved or uploaded
    * Edited
    * Marked for deletion
    * New - ID is null, OR'd with "Unchanged" and "Edited" only, "Delete" removes the label from the list immediately and **cannot be undone**.
* Label Actions - 
    * Entire list -  
        * "Upload Changes" or "Export Labels" -  
            * What ever is displayed in the list will be either(depending on user choice) uploaded to the selected repository (if one was selected) or saved to a JSON formatted file.
        * "Clear List" - list is emptied and all label references are reset
        * "~~Cancel /~~ Reload" - list is emptied and all label references are reset, labels are reloaded from the most recent *source*.
        * "~~Read /~~ Import" - import from file only, 
* List of Labels - sorted alphabetically by label text (*GitHub returns them already sorted*)

### Application States

            * Fill selection list with each repository's "`name`"
        * Repository information fields are empty or hidden
        * Label list is empty
        * Enable buttons - 
            * "Reload Repos", "Read / Import", "Create Label"
        * Disable buttons - 
            * "Read Labels", "Upload Changes", "Clear List", "Cancel / Reload", "Export Labels"

    * Check label list - 
        * Empty - do nothing
        * 1 or more labels - 
       

* "Read Labels" was clicked - 
    * Check label list - 
        * Empty - do nothing, continue
        * 1 or more labels - 
            * Prompt for "Keep / Merge" or "Clear" - save choice
